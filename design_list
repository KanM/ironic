Under discussed:

1. How to upload from iSCSI to the glance? Now seems like only the local file is allowed.

2. Windows & Linux & etc extension. A new plugin in the conductor side? Maybe a new directory named 'extension', just like 'drivers'.

3. Optional---The progress of the clone procedure.
   Another 'TIMEOUT' problem---Using inspector? TBD.
      A reference about deploy timeout handler: https://github.com/openstack/ironic/commit/ae79881bbc92fc8a8b1d8867ddd9bb7763d3813e

4. Get current clone step. No matter whether having a seperate API, or having a standalone 'clone_step' colume in node table.
   Prefer the latter one.

5. Cancel. Should be needed. Maybe can get some inspirations from the 'nova force-delete', or this spec may be helpful.

States for clone:
1. Adding into the provisioning state, which is the current state machine fsm.
2. Adding a new state like 'power' and 'provisioning'. Peer to them.

Maybe te second one. Having the states like:

    Clone States
         |_clone_wait?
         |_cloning
         |_clone_failed
         |_clone_success
         |_clone_cancelled

Reference about the CLEANWAIT:

When node is in CLEANWAIT it means that the ramdisk running on the node is doing some work and it could be abort-able via Ironic's API.
When the conductor is doing some work it should be at CLEANING state, which should be periodically checked to see if the conductor doing the work still up and running.

	2. some github code, focus on the conductor.https://github.com/openstack/ironic/commit/795b5e37caddf375f92248cbae084b8a20dccd52
	3. state spec.https://review.openstack.org/#/c/200521/
	4. add CLEANWAIT state:https://review.openstack.org/#/c/200152/
	5. allow CLEANWAIT abort.https://review.openstack.org/#/c/201552/
           The client has no code change;
           API changes provisioning state check with the newly added CLEANWAIT;
           Conductor.manager changes the 'do_provisioning_action' to apply the changes upstairs, also will call the '_do_clean_abort' when in CLEANWAIT branch;
	6. IPA response operation code.https://review.openstack.org/#/c/202137/
