Under discussed:

1. How to upload from iSCSI to the glance? Now seems like only the local file is allowed.

2. Windows & Linux & etc extension. A new plugin in the conductor side? Maybe a new directory named 'extension', just like 'drivers'.

3. Optional---The progress of the clone procedure.
   Another 'TIMEOUT' problem---Using inspector? TBD.
      A reference about deploy timeout handler: https://github.com/openstack/ironic/commit/ae79881bbc92fc8a8b1d8867ddd9bb7763d3813e

4. Get current clone step. No matter whether having a seperate API, or having a standalone 'clone_step' colume in node table.
   Prefer the latter one.

5. Cancel. Should be needed. Maybe can get some inspirations from the 'nova force-delete', or this spec may be helpful.

States for clone:
1. Adding into the provisioning state, which is the current state machine fsm.
2. Adding a new state like 'power' and 'provisioning'. Peer to them.

Maybe te second one. Having the states like:

    Clone States
         |_cloning
         |_clone_failed
         |_clone_success
         |_clone_cancelled
