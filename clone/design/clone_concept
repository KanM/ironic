============================
About the 'CLONE' in concept
============================

1. It is an operation
2. It is an event in work flow

Make a comparision with CLEAN
-----------------------------
CLEAN* is the trigger while the 'clean' is an event in the state machine
of provision.
The operation is started by changing the provision state, it corresponds
to the 'provisioning_error_handler' for error recycle.
The clean is executed as an event following the fsm principle within
provison, it correspnds to the 'cleaning_error_handler' for error recycle.

A reference about the NodeStatesController class in node.py on API level
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reflect to CLONE
----------------
So, the 'CLONE' should always like this to seperate from the concept level.

For CLONE, the design of separating operation and event is:

1. Add a 'target_clone_state' property in node.
    With clone state machine, all the clone state changes are triggered by
    the related clone command from API, and the conductor.manager will use
    the state to track the clone work flow backstage.

2. Make two error handler functions for two different levels.
    1) clone_error_handler for operation level
       This hook gets called upon an exception being raised when spawning
       the worker to do cloning to a node.
       This function is used in the process_clone_event, which is used in
       conductor.manager mainly.

    2) Another error handler function for event level
       This should be the error handler when in the ongoing clone process
       instead of the trigger clone action like provisioning.
       For now, this function is realized and commented. Should be renamed
       to separate from the previous one and used in the clone event process.
