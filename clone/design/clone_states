CLONE State

Ways of realization
-------------------
There are two ways of realizing the states of clone:
1. Adding into the provisioning state, which is the current state
   machine fsm.
2. Adding a new state like 'power' and 'provisioning'. Peer to them.
For the clone is even in concept of provisioning, here use the second
one in design.

Clone State Machine
-------------------
The design introduces a new state machine like provisionig state into
clone work flow, which is called clone state machine. The work flow of
the clone operations are drivern by the clone state associated with
the actions like "clone", "clone_abort" and "clone_clean". And the
clone event is processed mainly by the function in task_manager.

The 'faked' state machine of clone:

              INITIAL/AVAILABLE
                      |
                      |
                      v
CLONED --------- > [CLONING] ------ > [CLONE_WAIT] ---+
  ^    R:clone      | ^ | ^    wait       |  |        |
  |                 | | | |               |  |        |
  |     done        | | | |     resume    |  |        |
  +-----------------+ | | +---------------+  |fail    |
                      | |                    |        |
               R:clone| |fail                |        |
                      | |                    |        |
                      | |                    |        |
                      | v                    |        |
                   CLONE_FAIL < -------------+        |
                        ^                             |
                        |            R:abort          |
                        +-----------------------------+

* [STATE] indicates an active state. Ironic is doing cloning to the
  node.
* STATE indicates a stable (or passive) state. Ironic will not transition
  unless receiving a request via the API.
* R:request indicates the request which must be passed to the API to
  initiate a transition out of a stable state.


Description of the states
-------------------------
INITIAL/AVAILABLE
  This is the initial state of a node before clone.

CLONING
  When the conductor is doing some work it should be at CLONING state,
  which should be periodically checked to see if the conductor doing the
  work still up and running.

CLONE_WAIT
  When node is in CLONE_WAIT it means that the ramdisk running on the node
  is doing some work, for now the work are connecting the iSCSI disk and
  copy the content of disk on baremetal node to it.  And it could be abort-
  -able via Ironic's API.

CLONED
  This means the clone operation of baremetal node is successful.

CLONE_FAIL
  This means the clone operation of baremetal node is failed. It will happen
  either really fail from CLONING/CLONE_WAIT or abort from CLONE_WAIT.


Description of the requests
---------------------------
clone
  Trigger the clone operation of the node.

abort
  Abort the clone operation when the node is in CLONE_WAIT state.
