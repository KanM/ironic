The releationship of the 'maintenance' for the clone
====================================================

The maintenance introduction
----------------------------
The 'maintenance' is introduced in Icehouse release of Ironic.
The reference:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/1260099

Maintenance is used to take a node out of service temporarily.
From the description of the bp, maintenance-mode should only
prevent certain actions like deploying on the maintenance node.
It should not prevent the admin from doing such things as:
- accessing serial console
- managing power state
- deleting an instance
- [future] updating firmware
- [future] booting into a recovery or utility ramdisk,
           eg. to triage the hardware fault

The maintenance check in clone
------------------------------
Considering the clone operation is parallel with provision,
the maintenance should also be checked in clone process like
some provision processes do, such as deploy, rebuild and manual
clean.

Take the previous situation 'booting into a recovery or utility
ramdisk, eg. to triage the hardware fault' as the the clue, clone
also needs ramdisk to do some work in the process, like IPA copy
baremetal disk to iSCSI disk, which will confilict with the action
maintenance mode might does. So the maintenance check should be
done in clone process.

PS: Once it is confirmed that the maintenance has nothing to do
    with clone, the maintenance check related to clone could be
    removed.
