Under discussed:

1. How to upload from iSCSI to the glance? 
   Have left the interface to make a further progress, but for now
   would not implement to check the Cinder status. Would not need
   upload to Glance when the Cinder volume is allowded with Ironic.

2. Windows & Linux & etc extension.
   A new plugin in the conductor side? 
   Maybe a new directory named 'extension', just like 'drivers'.
   For an early version, would not realize this.

3. Optional---The progress of the clone procedure.
   Please refer to the 'clone_timeout' doc.

4. Get current clone step.
   No matter whether having a seperate API, or having a standalone
   'clone_step' colume in node table.
   Have added a column 'clone_step' in node to track the ongoing step
   of the clone provess.

5. Cancel.
   Should be needed. Maybe can get some inspirations from the
   'nova force-delete', or this spec may be helpful.

   This has not been merged, just a reference.
   But for 'abort' operation, we have an API left now to get node out of
   CLONE_WAIT state.


New questions when comparing to the CLEAN:
1. The clean pipeline has a validate in power, what for? Find it in code.
2. How is the continue_node_clean be used? Is it called like?
   IPA-->vendor_passthru-->API-->conductor.rpcapi-->conductor.manager
