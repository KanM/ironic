Under discussed:

1. How to upload from iSCSI to the glance? Now seems like only the local file is allowed.

2. Windows & Linux & etc extension. A new plugin in the conductor side? Maybe a new directory named 'extension', just like 'drivers'.

3. Optional---The progress of the clone procedure.
   Please refer to the 'clone_timeout' doc.

4. Get current clone step. No matter whether having a seperate API, or having a standalone 'clone_step' colume in node table.
   Prefer the latter one.

5. Cancel. Should be needed. Maybe can get some inspirations from the 'nova force-delete', or this spec may be helpful.

Reference about the CLEANWAIT:

When node is in CLEANWAIT it means that the ramdisk running on the node is doing some work and it could be abort-able via Ironic's API.
When the conductor is doing some work it should be at CLEANING state, which should be periodically checked to see if the conductor doing the work still up and running.

	1. bug 1455825.https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/1455825
	2. some github code, focus on the conductor.https://github.com/openstack/ironic/commit/795b5e37caddf375f92248cbae084b8a20dccd52
	3. state spec.https://review.openstack.org/#/c/200521/
	4. add CLEANWAIT state:https://review.openstack.org/#/c/200152/
	5. allow CLEANWAIT abort.https://review.openstack.org/#/c/201552/
           The client has no code change;
           API changes provisioning state check with the newly added CLEANWAIT;
           Conductor.manager changes the 'do_provisioning_action' to apply the changes upstairs, also will call the '_do_clean_abort' when in CLEANWAIT branch;
	6. IPA response operation code.https://review.openstack.org/#/c/202137/


New questions when comparing to the CLEAN:
1. The clean pipeline has a validate in power, what for? Find it in code.
2. How is the continue_node_clean be used? Is it called like?
   IPA-->vendor_passthru-->API-->conductor.rpcapi-->conductor.manager

New clues in CLEAN:
1. do_node_clean is used in the manual cleaning procedure, and it will be exposed to the API by a under review patch.
2. _do_node_clean is used in the automated cleaning procedure, it is triggered in the provision or tear_down.
